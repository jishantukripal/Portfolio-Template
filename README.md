## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these simple steps to clone, install, and run the portfolio template locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-template.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd portfolio-template
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

To view the portfolio locally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The portfolio should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 5. Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy the portfolio, create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build/` folder.

### 6. Customize Your Portfolio

- Update the **content**: Modify the JSX components in the `src/components` folder to add your personal details, projects, and links.
- **Change the styles**: The project is styled with Tailwind CSS. You can easily update styles by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file or applying utility classes directly in the components.
  
### 7. Toggle Dark/Light Mode

The dark/light mode feature is built-in using Tailwind CSS's theme feature. Toggle between themes by clicking the **theme switcher** button on the top right corner of the site. The state is managed using `useState` and saved to `localStorage` so the preference persists between sessions.
